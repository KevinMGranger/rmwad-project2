# IGME-330 (Rich Media Web App Dev) Project 2 Proposal for Kevin Granger


## The Idea

I'm part of the RIT admissions social media team. We help manage incoming students who try to connect to each other.
In the past, we've had a semi-custom webapp for students, which eventually evolved away from its purpose, and was shut down.
We've adapted to using a Facebook group, but it's not ideal for students trying to find roommates by similar major, hometown, etc.

I'd like to make a web app that will allow incoming RIT students sign in with various forms of social media, and then connect with them through their supplied information, on their supplied forms of social media.

In other words, instead of trying to make an alternative to Facebook (ugh), it will suggest people to *add* on Facebook.

It shall be called:

*Tiger Safari*

* working title
* probably a bad title
* a pack of tigers is called a streak but I can't exactly call it *Tiger Streaker*


## Web Technologies

* Facebook, possibly Twitter APIs
* Geolocation


## Partner

This is a strange request. I'd like to work mostly alone, but with some possible assistance from another member of the Social Media team. They are not in the class.
If that doesn't work, I will probably work alone, although there is someone in the class who has worked with admissions on similar stuff in the past (I think?) and I may ask them if they want to partner up.
